# TCP/IP Chat
A TCP/IP chatroom console application used for private networks. 1:1 Peer IPv4 connections.

## Installation
I recommend using a current version of [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) for building as it includes all Winsock dependencies.

## Usage
Needs a minimum of two instances running, one as a host and one as a client.

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. This is very bare-bones, I'd like to add a GUI, port-forwarding, a port for Linux, and maybe some other fun things.
